While the specific meaning and implications of "MVP" have been done to death by thousands of other writers, I'm going to attempt re-iterate the need to distinguish "Minimum Viable Product" and "Minimum Desirable Product." These two terms are frequently at odds with one another, with MVP more often than not being used when MDP is the intended term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll start with two somewhat subjective definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimum Viable Product - The actual minimum product necessary to test assumptions and potentially prove the existence of a market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum Desirable Product - The smallest possible feature set product owners are willing to launch with&lt;/li&gt;
