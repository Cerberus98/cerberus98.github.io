You can think of it as an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino"&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard"&gt;breadboard&lt;/a&gt;. Included in the kit are various sensors as well as a wonderful little guide walking you through the setup and introducing a lot of basic electronics concepts like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law"&gt;Ohms Law&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas an Arduino is a great jumping off point for creating lots of amazing projects quickly, it abstracts a lot of the nitty-gritty that I like to get into. It's kind of like learning to program in BASIC before tackling a lower-level language; more programmers than ever get through their entire career without knowing C, and I'm sure a lot of electronics hobbyists don't care to learn AVR-C or what makes a &lt;a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/Bootloader?from=Tutorial.Bootloader"&gt;bootloader&lt;/a&gt; work. This is why I like the Nerdkit so much: you're essentially building an Arduino from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst tinkering with said Nerdkit in the first few months, I managed to corrupt the bootloader on the chip. No matter what I tried, I couldn't flash new programs. Hours of frustration later, the Nerdkit ended up in a box in favor of less complicated things. Fast-forward a few years, and I find the Nerdkit and all the pieces in a box, and the memories of defeat come flooding back and so I decided this time I was going to get it working.&lt;/p&gt;
