    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>A frequent point of contention when developing new products is just how many features should be implemented before the product can be rolled out the door. While the specific meaning and implications of "MVP" have been done to death by thousands of other writers, I'm going to attempt re-iterate the need to distinguish "Minimum Viable Product" and "Minimum Desirable Product." These two terms are frequently at odds with one another, with MVP more often than not being used when MDP is the intended term.</p>
<p>I'll start with two somewhat subjective definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum Viable Product - The actual minimum product necessary to test assumptions and potentially prove the existence of a market</li>
<li>Minimum Desirable Product - The smallest possible feature set product owners are willing to launch with</li>
</ul>
<p>Product owners often begin using "minimum viable product" in sentences after having read <em>The Lean Startup,</em> guessing at the intent of the book while completely missing the point: that an MVP is <strong>almost always</strong> more duct tape and bailing wire than it is automated software and polish. I've seen people un-ironically use the term MVP when explaining that a given product can't be launched without 90% of the overall road-mapped feature set. This is where "minimum desirable product," or MDP, is the better acronym. Your product owner is essentially telling you that the product isn't viable without the majority of the vision.</p>
<p>Put differently, I believe the hesistation to equate MDP with MVP stems from the word "incomplete." One needs to eliminate the word "incomplete" from any conversation regarding the MVP. The MVP can't be incomplete; it's precisely the set of features you agree to build. Unfortunately, it's hard to change this mindset once it's established, largely because it's difficult to put your name on something that is invariably going to look so utterly unattractive. You yourself may find it hard to believe that anyone will give you money for the MVP. However, the ability to scrap a misfire early is worth its weight in salaried developer hours. It's your responsibility to try to convince the rest of your team and your product owners that it's in their best interest to release early and iterate. The only feeling worse than releasing a broken product is releasing something no one wants, and we've all been there.</p>
<p>I recently worked on a product that involved developing nearly every feature on the roadmap before it was considered launch worthy. Meanwhile, my team argued that the product could have been represented by a handful of scripts and some manual labor. It sounds scary to ask customers to pay for a patchwork mess but the upshot is we could have launched a workable solution in under a week, tested our assumptions, conversed with the customers to figure out the next steps and most importantly proven it can work <strong>at all.</strong> Instead, we spent months in meetings building a nearly finished product and it could have all been for nothing. At the time of this writing, we still haven't launched the feature, so the outcome is unknown!</p>
<p>You've likely experienced the alternate form of this problem: you start with a manageable workload and then the product manager scope creeps with "edge cases" that end up being features in disguise. Unfortunately, if this happens, it's probably your fault: you should have been working with the product manager and gotten him or her to agree to a fixed contract and timeline. The product managers job is to <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/entropy-crushers/">remove chaos</a>, but he or she can't do that if you aren't taking the design portion seriously, including estimates of well-defined features.</p>
<p>The ability to release early is the sign of both a mature team and a product owner willing to put the product itself ahead of his or her own ego. The MDP has to look as close to the MVP as possible, lest you risk wasted time, money and sanity. It's your job to convince your product owners that it's in their best interest to release early and add polish later.</p>

    <p>I've been wanting to use my Mikrotik to update DynDNS for some time. After digging, I found out that newer firmware had a "Cloud" option that effectively accomplishes it, but I wanted to use a domain I registered through Namecheap instead. Some googling showed that the "Scripts" functionality of the router was perfectly suited to the task; coupled with scheduling, I was good to go.</p>
<p>You're going to want to go to Namecheap and enable DynDNS for the domain you'd like to use. Checkout <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/43/11/how-do-i-setup-a-host-for-dynamic-dns">How do I setup a Host for Dynamic DNS?</a> and <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/595/11/how-do-i-enable-dynamic-dns-for-a-domain">How do I enable Dynamic DNS for a domain?</a> for more information on getting that setup. After you've done so, Namecheap will show you a password; be sure to copy that.</p>
<p>Next, log into your router. I find that the Winbox interface is by far the easiest for this task. WINE does a pretty good approximation of Winbox if you don't have a windows box lying somewhere around. Meanwhile, I know there's an OSX client, but the download is suspiciously 151MB, whereas the Windows binary is in the neighborhood of 11MB.</p>
<p>After you've logged in, click on "System," then navigate down to "Scripts." Click on "Add New" and enter a name like "dyndns." Finally, paste the following in the "source" field:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="cp"># Set local variables. If you want to update subdomain.example.com, put in "subdomain" under subdomain and "example.com" in the domain variable. If you want to update just example.com with no subdomain, enter in "@" for the subdomain.</span>

<span class="o">:</span><span class="n">local</span> <span class="n">password</span> <span class="s">"&lt;namecheap provided password&gt;"</span>
<span class="o">:</span><span class="n">local</span> <span class="n">subdomain</span> <span class="s">""</span>
<span class="o">:</span><span class="n">local</span> <span class="n">domain</span> <span class="s">"&lt;the domain&gt;.&lt;tld&gt;"</span>

<span class="cp"># Get Public IP</span>

<span class="o">:</span><span class="n">local</span> <span class="n">currentIP</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">file</span> <span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">pubIP</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">txt</span> <span class="n">contents</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">:</span><span class="n">log</span> <span class="n">info</span> <span class="s">"Current Public IP is:$currentIP"</span>

<span class="o">:</span><span class="n">local</span> <span class="n">url1</span> <span class="s">"http://dynamicdns.park-your-domain.com/update</span><span class="se">\3</span><span class="s">Fhost=$subdomain&amp;domain=$domain&amp;password=$password&amp;ip=$currentIP"</span>
<span class="o">/</span><span class="n">tool</span> <span class="n">fetch</span> <span class="n">url</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="n">url1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">mode</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">http</span>
<span class="o">:</span><span class="n">log</span> <span class="n">info</span> <span class="s">"DNS Successfully Updated"</span>
</pre>


<p>Leaving the subdomain field as an empty string is perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p>Test the script out using the "Run Script" button. If everything has gone well, you should see new lines in your "Log" menu. Furthermore, you'll see some files in the root of the router under the "File" menu. These were created by the script above to shuttle the data around.</p>
<p>Next, you're going to want to set up a schedule. Ensure the clock is set correctly on your router: I recommend setting up SNTP. Once you've done that, click on "System" once again, and then "Scheduler." From there, click "Add New." The name of the job can be anything you'd like. Set the "Start Date" and "Start Time" to be today and in the near future. Finally, the "Interval" field is HH:MM:SS. I've seen people use it as frequently as every minute, but that seems like overkill. I'd also guess that Namecheap is likely to rate-limit you eventually. My own public IP only seems to change if there's a power outage, so I set the updates to be much less frequent. Finally, in the "On Event" field, put just the name of the script as you entered it previously. After that, you should have a scheduled Namecheap DynDNS updater.</p>

    <p>A recent Hacker News post mentioned producing crap. I've been so focused on trying to only put good things online that I've avoided just writing anything that may be less than optimal which, as the post suggested, implied that I'd never write anything at all. As such, I've decided to write about team communication, both externally and internally.</p>
<p>One of the things my team is struggling is communication, especially when it comes to remote workers. My belief is that you need to "lower" the tier of communication to the level of the most disadvantaged co-worker. If everyone is available and in-person, bringing all the relevant people into the conversation face-to-face is the optimal solution. Meanwhile, if at least one person is in another city, state or country, everyone should communicate as much as possible using the most convenient medium available to those peers. Be it Skype, IRC, email or even smoke signals, unless careful attention is paid to ensuring your co-workers stay in the loop, invariably someone will be left out of an important conversation and feelings will be hurt.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: We have not objectively solved this problem, but my hope is we get a little better every day.</p>
<p>So this leaves the team with a conundrum: the mechanism of communication is likely less optimal than a closed door room full of whiteboards. In other words, your situation <em>sucks</em>, but imagine how the remote developers feel. Emphasis should be placed on maximizing collaboration while minimizing frustrating interaction. This usually requires effort and often money, too. Where does that leave half remote, half local teams? Ideally, you split the remote and local developers into focus groups, so that in-person communication doesn't need to be reproduced for the one or more remote peers. To put it another way, no one wants to play the secretary, and if someone does, the remote end likely receives a less than optimal description of the localized conversation.</p>
<p>In short, remote communication is a huge hurdle, and I don't think there are any easy answers, but the value of feeling like an equal contributor out weighs the pain of bridging the communication gaps.</p>
<p>Tools that we like / ameliorate the problem:</p>
<ul>

<li>IRC - We use both <a href="http://www.freenode.net">Freenode</a> and an internal server.</li>

    <p>I recently competed in Ludum Dare 27, and one of the biggest struggles I had was making an application I built on the command line on my machine actually run for others. The first sign that I should have considered alternative frameworks was when I could only get SFML to link properly into my game when I built it from bleeding edge source. However, I'd been trucking along just fine using the compiled dylibs. I had been assuming the entire time that it was sufficient to include code and instructions for building the project yourself, but when the barrier to entry is too high, people will simply prefer all the Unity and HTML5 Canvas games. It's hard to blame them, really.</p>
<p>So, I set out to figure out how to package up SFML with my binary and ship it. After stumbling through a bunch of mediocre attempts to include the SFML dylibs in the zip file I submitted ot the competition, I finally realized the only thing left to do was construct a Mac app bundle.</p>
<p>Enter XCode.</p>
<p>Getting my project set up was relatively easy, especially using the SFML templates that the SFML installer created for me. However, the first headache came when I tried to build the project against the default settings. After some Googling, I finally stumbled across a <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.0/start-osx.php">SFML Tutorial</a> about setting up a "Hello World" style Xcode project using SFML. I proceeded to import all the files I'd been working on into XCode, triggered a build and... linker errors. I tried going back to installing the packaged SFML, to no avail. Switched back to compiling frameworks, but had issues with them (though I now realize why that route failed, more below.) and finally went back to where I started, building dylibs from source.</p>
<p>After digging for a bit, I realized the errors I was getting were a lot better than I'd originally given them credit for. Namely, my issue is the default cmake settings for SFML only produce bleeding edge, current OS/X settings, and only for the active architecture. At this point, I should have realized toggling the architecture setting in XCode would have solved my framework issue, but I digress.</p>
<p>Toggling the "architecture" flag did it! To find it in XCode 4.3, click on the folder icon on the left side, then click on the very top element, which is your project. The center pane will update, with new tabs across the top. Click on "Build Settings" and play with "Valid Architectures" setting. Following this, I had success! Well, mostly. None of my game content was actually in the bundle. Now, I'm no XCode expert, so I'm sure this is the wrong way to do things, but adding said content was as simple as a Right-Click -&gt; "Show Contents" on the bundle. From there, I traversed through Contents -&gt; MacOS and dumped all the files there. Finally, it worked! I zipped up the game, uploaded it, and sent it some friends.</p>
<p>Immediate disaster! One of my friends is running OS/X 10.7, and was seeing errors about being unable to find SFML dylibs. Obviously, when you lose a weekend and large amounts of sleep to something you've built, you want others to at least see what you've done. Therefore, back to Google I went. I eventually stumbled on <a href="http://www.mjbshaw.com/2013/02/building-sfml-2-with-c11-on-os-x.html">this blog</a> where he describes building SFML with different CMake settings. Coupled with a Stack Overflow post that pointed out the obvious; that your linked libraries need to be built with an SDK version &lt;= your project SDK version. Derp.</p>
<p>The final pain was figuring out where the XCode SDKs had moved. Every link on Google said they should have been in /Developer, off the root. However, just like a million other annoying things, Lion moved it.</p>
<p>The new location is under /Application/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the way to build SFML source:</p>
